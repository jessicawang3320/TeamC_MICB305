## Agenda for today:

1) Go over the metadata to see if its appropriate for downstream analysis
2) Troubleshoot problems with uploading metadata file to class server 
3) Questions for clarification (Will we be marked on aesthetics for the proposal, is there a specific font size we need to adhere to?, when we are writing our proposal should we mention the novelty of our research topic?) 
4) Go over research outline 

## Team Meeting Notes (Date: 10/28/2025):
- Refine aims (make it more specific)
- Metadata is ready to go 
- Could go into how oral vaccine is not traditional
- Times New Roman, 12 pt 
- Make sure that the tables and figures are well formatted!
- Ensure that content of the proposal meets the critera (marking is heavily based on content, not so much aesthetics)

## To-Do List:
- Complete the project proposal (DUE: NOV 2ND - THIS SUNDAY)
