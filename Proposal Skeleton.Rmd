# Title: Examining Gut Microbial Diversity as a Determinant of Host Responsiveness to Vaccination

# Team C: [Insert Names]

# Introduction & Background
 - Why is this topic important? (i.e. clinical relevance, how is our world impacted by this, what consequences the virus may convey)
- What are the key players in the context of our research? (i.e. factors or key players that contribute or are involved into MOA of typhoid) 
- What research has been done so far? (i.e. has there been research done in regards to the relationship between microbial diversity and host responsiveness to vaccines, if no prior research then state novelty of the research question) 
- What are the blanks that still need to be filled in or what gaps are there in current knowledge? 
State how our research question will address the knowledge gaps and how this analysis will be carried out briefly 

# Hypothesis or Prediction
- State research question
- Explain what this study will explore
